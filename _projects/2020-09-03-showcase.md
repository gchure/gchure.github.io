In addition to photography, I focus my artistic streak on making high-quality
illustrations for talks, papers, and presentations, some of which are shown
below. I also think that the future of publishing will **not** include `PDF`
file formats. Therefore, I enjoy making interactive figures and pedagogical
tools. This page shows a bunch of those examples with some descriptions. All
interactive figures were built using the [Bokeh plotting
library](http://bokeh.pydata.org) in Python. The script used to generate it
can be downloaded from the link below each figure.
 

This page will look pretty weird on a phone or tablet screen. Things are much
easier to interact with on a computer.

## A two-dimensional random walk
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/diffusion_bug.png)

Random walk processes can be used to explain an enormous variety of physical
phenomena and is the basis for one of my favorite computational techniques,
Markov chain Monte Carlo. The interactive tool below allows you to create a two
dimensional random walk of $$10^5$$ steps. The left plot will show the entire
random walk while the right plot will show the current position and the previous
5000 steps. Adjust the slider to move the particle along its path.

## Gillespie simulation of a constitutive promoter
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/constitutive_promoter.png)

[The Gillespie algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm) is an incredibly powerful computational technique to
simulate stochastic processes and numerically compute distributions of otherwise
hard-to-solve differential equations. The tool below lets you perform a
Gillespie simulation of a constitutively expressing promoter (i.e. not
regulated) at the level of mRNAs. While the ODE is trivial to solve (equation in
the box above), it's illustrative to run the simulation to see how it can be
reproduced numerically. In the interactive, thin purple lines correspond to the simulations
whereas the orange line presents the analytical solution given the input parameters.

## The Bayesian coin flip
---
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/coin_flip.png)

This interactive illustrates how a posterior probability distribution over the
bias of a coin is influenced by the number of flips and the parameters of the
prior distribution. In this example, the likelihood is a Binomial distribution
of the form

$$
f(n\,\vert\,N, p) = \frac{N!}{n! (N - n)!}p^n(1 - p)^{N - n},
$$

where $$N$$ is the number of flips total and $$n$$ is the number of heads. The 
conjugate prior of the Binomial likelihood is a Beta distribution parameterized 
by $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$, 

$$
f(p\,\vert\, \alpha, \beta) = \frac{p^{\alpha - 1} ( 1- p)^{\beta -
1}}{\mathbf{B}(\alpha, \beta)},
$$

where $$\mathbf{B}(\alpha, \beta)$$ is a normalization factor defined as 

$$
\mathbf{B}(\alpha, \beta) = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta)},
$$

where $$\Gamma(\dots)$$ is a Gamma function.

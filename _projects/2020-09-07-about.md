I’m a postdoctoral scholar in the lab of [Rob Phillips](https://rpgroup.caltech.edu) at [Caltech](https://caltech.edu) in Pasadena, CA. I love anything microbial, quantitative, or wrapped in
tortillas. I firmly believe that the future of biology relies on an intuition
for the physics that governs it. I believe this is especially true for
evolutionary biology where insights from statistical mechanics will help shed
light on the fundamental evolutionary processes that sculpt genomes.

I am passionate about programming and promote the use of open source software
for scientific computing. As outlined on my research page, I have been using
GitHub as a lab notebook where all code, data, and visualizations are freely
and easily available to the public. I've turned my work-flow into a [template GitHub repository](https://github.com/gchure/reproducible_research) so bench scientists can start doing open-source
science without the organizational overhead. Eventually, I’ll write something
up about my experience with structuring my research to be open and
reproducible from project inception.

Outside of science, I love taking [photographs](https://gchure.github.io/photography), making programmatically
generated art and exploring the wild lands of California / Rocky Mountain
West. Being married to a [screen writer](https://barbarasoares.com), I also watch my fair share of films
and television on which I have hard-headed opinions.

  Theoretical Investigation of a Genetic Switch for Metabolic Adaptation 
abstract: >
  Membrane transporters carry key metabolites across the cell membrane and, from
  a resource standpoint, are hypothesized to be produced when necessary. The
  expression of membrane transporters in metabolic pathways is often upregulated
  by the transporter substrate. In <i>E. coli</i>, such systems include for example the
  <i>lacY</i>, <i>araFGH</i>, and <i>xylFGH</i> genes, which encode for lactose, arabinose, and
  xylose transporters, respectively. As a case study of a minimal system, we
  build a generalizable physical model of the <i>xapABR</i> genetic circuit, which
  features a regulatory feedback loop via membrane transport (positive
  feedback) and enzymatic degradation (negative feedback) of an inducer.
  Dynamical systems analysis and stochastic simulations show that the membrane
  transport makes the model system bistable in certain parameter regimes. Thus,
  it serves as a genetic “on-off” switch, enabling the cell to only produce a
  set of metabolic enzymes when the corresponding metabolite is present in large
  amounts. We find that the negative feedback from the degradation enzyme does
  not significantly disturb the positive feedback from the membrane
  transporter. We investigate hysteresis in the switching and discuss the role
  of cooperativity and multiple binding sites in the model circuit.
  Fundamentally, this work explores how a stable genetic switch for a set of
  enzymes is obtained from transcriptional auto-activation of a membrane
  transporter through its substrate.

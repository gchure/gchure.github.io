    Fundamental Limits on the Rate of Bacterial Growth and Their Influence on
    Proteomic Composition<sup>†</sup>
abstract: >
    Despite abundant measurements of bacterial growth rate, cell size, and
    protein content, we lack a rigorous understanding of what sets the scale of
    these quantities and when protein abundances should (or should not) depend
    on growth rate. Here, we estimate the basic requirements and physical
    constraints on steady-state growth by considering key processes in cellular
    physiology across a collection of <i>Escherichia coli</i> proteomic data covering
    ≈ 4,000 proteins and 36 growth rates. Our analysis suggests that cells are
    predominantly tuned for the task of cell doubling across a continuum of
    growth rates; specific processes do not limit growth rate or dictate cell
    size. We present a model of proteomic regulation as a function of nutrient
    supply that reconciles observed interdependences between protein synthesis,
    cell size, and growth rate and propose that a theoretical inability to
    parallelize ribosomal synthesis places a firm limit on the achievable growth
    rate.
summary: >
    The behavior of cells is predominantly guided by the set of genes that are 
    active, meaning they are being used (in most cases) to make proteins. 
    While an organism like a bacterium may have several thousand genes, not all
    of them are being used at once, and the ones that are used are typically 
    used in different amounts in different environmental conditions. While many
    careful measurements of how many proteins each gene is making have been made
    in well-studied organisms like the bacterium <i>E. coli</i>, we remain largely
    ignorant of <i>why</i> the different proteins are made at different levels. In
    this paper, we use very simple mathematics to make an order-of-magnitude
    estimate of how many proteins would be needed for many of the major
    processes cells have to undertake. We see if these estimates are reasonable
    by comparing them to measurements, revealing that in almost all cases that
    they are accurate. We then use these estimates to arrive at the conclusion
    that the proteins needed to make other proteins imposes a strict speed limit
    on how fast cells can grow, and their abundances can be used to predict this
    speed.

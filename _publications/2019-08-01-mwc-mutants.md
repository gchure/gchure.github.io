  Predictive Shifts in Free Energy Couple Mutations to Their Phenotypic Consequences. 
abstract: >
  Mutation is a critical mechanism by which evolution explores the functional
  landscape of proteins. Despite our ability to experimen- tally inflict mutations
  at will, it remains difficult to link sequence- level perturbations to
  systems-level responses. Here, we present a framework centered on measuring
  changes in the free energy of the system to link individual mutations in an
  allosteric transcrip- tional repressor to the parameters which govern its
  response. We find that the energetic effects of the mutations can be categorized
  into several classes which have characteristic curves as a func- tion of the
  inducer concentration. We experimentally test these diagnostic predictions using
  the well-characterized LacI repressor of Escherichia coli, probing several
  mutations in the DNA bind- ing and inducer binding domains. We find that the
  change in gene expression due to a point mutation can be captured by modifying
  only the model parameters that describe the respec- tive domain of the wild-type
  protein. These parameters appear to be insulated, with mutations in the DNA
  binding domain altering only the DNA affinity and those in the inducer binding
  domain altering only the allosteric parameters. Changing these subsets of
  parameters tunes the free energy of the system in a way that is concordant with
  theoretical expectations. Finally, we show that the induction profiles and
  resulting free energies associated with pairwise double mutants can be predicted
  with quantitative accu- racy given knowledge of the single mutants, providing an
  avenue for identifying and quantifying epistatic interactions.

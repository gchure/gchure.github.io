    `hplc-py`: A Python Package For Rapid Peak Quantification in Complex Chromatograms 
abstract: >
    High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Gas Chromatography are
    analytical techniques which allow for the quantitative characterization of
    the chemical components of mixtures. Technological advancements in sample
    preparation and mechanical automation have allowed HPLC to become a
    high-throughput tool which poses new challenges for reproducible and rapid
    analysis of the resulting chromatograms. Here we present `hplc-py`, a Python
    package that permits rapid and reliable quantitation of component signals
    within a chromatogram for pipelined workflows. This is achieved by a signal
    detection and quantitation algorithm which i) identifies windows of time
    which contain peaks and ii) infers the parameters of a mixture of
    amplitude-weighted skew-normal distributions which sum to reconstruct the
    observed signal. This approach is particularly effective at deconvolving
    highly overlapping signals, allowing for precise absolute quantitation of
    chemical constituents with similar chromatographic retention times

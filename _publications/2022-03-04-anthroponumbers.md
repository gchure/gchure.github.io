    Anthroponumbers.org: A Quantitative Database of Human Impacts on Planet Earth 
abstract: >
    Over the last 10,000 years, human activities have transformed the Earth
    through farming, forestry, mining and industry. The complex results of these
    activities are now observed and quantified as “human impacts” on Earth’s
    atmosphere, oceans, biosphere and geochemistry. While myriad studies have
    explored facets of human impacts on the planet, they are necessarily
    technical and often tightly-focused. Thus, finding reliable quantitative
    information requires a significant investment of time to assess each
    quantity, its methods of determination, and associated uncertainty. We
    present the Human Impacts Database (www.anthroponumbers.org), which houses a
    diverse array of such quantities. We review a subset of these values and how
    they help build intuition for understanding the Earth-human system. While
    collation alone does not tell us how to best ameliorate human impacts, we
    contend that any future plans should be made in light of a quantitative
    understanding of the interconnected ways in which humans impact the planet.

    Quantifying the Daily Harvest of Fermentation Products From the Human Gut Microbiota
abstract: >
    Fermentation products released by the gut microbiota provide energy and
    important regulatory functions for the host. Yet, little quantitative
    information is available on the metabolite exchange between the microbiota and
    the human host, and thus the effective doses of fermentation products. Here, we
    introduce an integrative framework combining experimental characterization of
    major gut bacteria with a quantitative analysis of human digestive physiology to
    put numbers on this exchange and its dependence on diet and microbiota
    composition. From the carbohydrates fueling microbiota growth, we find most
    carbon ends up in fermentation products which are largely utilized by the host.
    This harvest varies strongly with diet, from between 100-700 mmol/day within the
    US population to up to 1300 for the Hadza people of Tanzania. Accordingly,
    fermentation products cover between 1.8% and 12.1% of the daily energy demand of
    human hosts, substantially less than the 21% estimated for laboratory mice. In
    contrast, microbiota composition has little impact on the total daily harvest
    but determines the harvest of specific fermentation products. Butyrate, known
    for promoting epithelial health, shows the biggest variation. Our framework thus
    identifies and quantifies major factors driving the metabolic and signaling
    interactions between microbiota and host, crucial to mechanistically dissect the
    role of the microbiota in health and disease.

    First-Principles Prediction of the Information Processing Capacity of a Simple Genetic Circuit<sup>†</sup>
abstract: >
  Given the stochastic nature of gene expression, genetically identical cells
  exposed to the same environmental inputs will produce different outputs. This
  heterogeneity has been hypothesized to have consequences for how cells are
  able to survive in changing environments. Recent work has explored the use of
  information theory as a framework to understand the accuracy with which cells
  can ascertain the state of their surroundings. Yet the predictive power of
  these approaches is limited and has not been rigorously tested using precision
  measurements. To that end, we generate a minimal model for a simple genetic
  circuit in which all parameter values for the model come from independently
  published data sets. We then predict the information processing capacity of
  the genetic circuit for a suite of biophysical parameters such as protein copy
  number and protein-DNA affinity. We compare these parameter-free predictions
  with an experimental determination of protein expression distributions and the
  resulting information processing capacity of <i>E. coli</i> cells. We find that our
  minimal model captures the scaling of the cell-to-cell variability in the data
  and the inferred information processing capacity of our simple genetic circuit
  up to a systematic deviation.

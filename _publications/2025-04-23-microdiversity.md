    Paradox of the Sub-Plankton: Plausible Mechanisms and Open Problems Underlying Strain-Level Diversity in Microbial Communities
abstract: >
    Microbial communities are often complex and highly diverse, typically with dozens of species sharing spatially-restricted environments. Within these species, genetic and ecological variation often exists at a much finer scale, with closely related strains coexisting and competing. While the coexistence of strains in communities has been heavily explored over the past two decades, we have no self-consistent theory of how this diversity is maintained. This question challenges our conventional understanding of ecological coexistence, typically framed around species with clear phenotypic and ecological differences. In this review, we synthesise plausible mechanisms underlying strain-level diversity (termed microdiversity), focusing on niche-based mechanisms such as nutrient competition, neutral mechanisms such as migration, and evolutionary mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer. We critically assess the strengths and caveats of these mechanisms, acknowledging key gaps that persist in linking genetic similarity to ecological divergence. Finally, we highlight how the origin and maintenance of microdiversity could pose a major challenge to conventional ecological thinking. We articulate a call-to-arms for a dialogue between well-designed experiments and new theoretical frameworks to address this grand conceptual challenge in understanding microbial biodiversity.

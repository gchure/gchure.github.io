  Sequence-dependent dynamics of synthetic and endogenous RSSs in V(D)J recombination
abstract: >
  Developing lymphocytes of jawed vertebrates cleave and combine distinct gene
  segments to assemble antigen–receptor genes. This process called V(D)J
  recombination that involves the RAG recombinase binding and cutting
  recombination signal sequences (RSSs) composed of conserved heptamer and nonamer 
  sequences flanking less well-conserved 12- or 23-bp spacers. Little
  quantitative information is known about the contributions of individual RSS
  positions over the course of the RAG–RSS interaction. We employ a
  single-molecule method known as tethered particle motion to track the
  formation, lifetime and cleavage of individual RAG–12RSS–23RSS paired
  complexes (PCs) for numerous synthetic and endogenous 12RSSs. We reveal that
  single-bp changes, including in the 12RSS spacer, can significantly and
  selectively alter PC formation or the probability of RAG-mediated cleavage
  in the PC. We find that some rarely used endogenous gene segments can be
  mapped directly to poor RAG binding on their adjacent 12RSSs. Finally, we find
  that while abro gating RSS nicking with Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to substantially shorter
  PC lifetimes, analysis of the complete lifetime distributions of any 12RSS
  even on this reduced system reveals that the process of exiting the PC involves 
  unidentified molecular details whose involvement in RAG–RSS dynamics
  are crucial to quantitatively capture kinetics in V(D)J recombination.

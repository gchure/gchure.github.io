    An Optimal Regulation of Fluxes Dictates Microbial Growth In and Out of Steady-State
abstract: >
    Effective coordination of cellular processes is critical to ensure the
    competitive growth of microbial organisms. Pivotal to this coordination is the
    appropriate partitioning of cellular resources between protein synthesis via
    translation and the metabolism needed to sustain it. Here, we present a
    coarse-grained and organism-agnostic theory of microbial growth centered on the
    dynamic regulation of this resource partitioning. At the core of this regulation
    is an optimization of metabolic and translational fluxes, mechanistically
    achieved via the perception of charged- and uncharged-tRNA turnover. An
    extensive comparison with ≈ 50 data sets from Escherichia coli establishes the
    theory’s veracity and shows that it can predict a remarkably wide range of
    growth phenomena in and out of steady-state with quantitative accuracy. This
    predictive power, achieved with only a few biological parameters, cements the
    preeminent importance of protein synthesis in microbial growth and establishes
    the theory as an ideal physiological framework to interrogate the dynamics of
    growth, competition, and adaptation in complex and ever-changing environments.

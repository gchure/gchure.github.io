    The Anthropocene by the Numbers: A Quantitative Snapshot of Humanity's Influence on the Planet 
abstract: >
   The presence and action of humans on Earth has exerted a strong influence on
   the evolution of the planet over the past ≈ 10,000 years, the consequences of
   which are now becoming broadly evident. Despite a deluge of tightly-focused
   and necessarily technical studies exploring each facet of "human impacts" on
   the planet, their integration into a complete picture of the human-Earth
   system lags far behind. Here, we quantify twelve dimensionless ratios which
   put the magnitude of human impacts in context, comparing the magnitude of
   anthropogenic processes to their natural analogues. These ratios capture the
   extent to which humans alter the terrestrial surface, hydrosphere, biosphere,
   atmosphere, and biogeochemistry of Earth. In almost all twelve cases, the
   impact of human processes rivals or exceeds their natural counterparts. The
   values and corresponding uncertainties for these impacts at global and
   regional resolution are drawn from the primary scientific literature,
   governmental and international databases, and industry reports. We present
   this synthesis of the current "state of affairs" as a graphical snapshot
   designed to be used as a reference. Furthermore, we establish a searchable
   database termed the <a href="http://anthroponumbers.org">Human Impacts Database</a> 
   which houses all quantities reported here and many others with extensive
   curation and annotation. While necessarily incomplete, this work collates and
   contextualizes a set of essential numbers summarizing the broad impacts of
   human activities on Earth's atmosphere, land, water, and biota.

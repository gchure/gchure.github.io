    Stringent Control Over Cytoplasmic and Membrane Densities Defines Cell Geometry In <i>Escherichia coli</i>
abstract: >
    Microbes exhibit precise control over their composition and geometry in
    order to adapt and grow in diverse environments. However, the mechanisms
    that orchestrate this simultaneous regulation, and how they are causally
    linked, remains poorly understood. In this work, we derive and
    experimentally test a biophysical model of cell size regulation in
    Escherichia coli which relates the cellular surface-to-volume ratio to the
    total macromolecular composition and partitioning of the proteome between
    cellular compartments. Central to this model is the observation that the
    macromolecular density of the cytoplasm and the protein density within the
    cell membranes are maintained at a constant ratio across growth conditions.
    Using quantitative mass spectrometry, single-cell microscopy, and
    biochemical assays, we show this model quantitatively predicts a non-linear
    relationship between the surface-to-volume ratio, proteome localization, and
    the total ribosome content of the cell. This model holds under perturbations
    of intracellular ppGpp concentrations-thereby changing the ribosomal
    content-demonstrating that cellular geometry is not strictly determined by
    the cellular growth rate. These findings provide a biophysical link between
    the coregulation of proteome organization and cellular geometry, offering a
    quantitative framework for understanding bacterial size regulation across
    conditions.

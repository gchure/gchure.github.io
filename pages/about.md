The short version is that I'm a biologist turning into a physicist. The slightly
longer version is that I'm an NSF postdoctoral fellow at Stanford sitting in the
lab of <a href="https://cremerlab.com">Jonas Cremer</a> where I use principles
of bacterial physiology to make predictive models of evolution. I firmly believe
that the future of biology relies on an intuition for the physics that governs
it, especially in evolutionary biology.

Being the spawn of two paleontologists, I grew up in rural Utah where I was
raised in  a concoction of contradictions. While my weekends were spent with my
parents helping dig up dinosaur bones and grappling with geology of my
surroundings, my weekdays were spent in the rural public education system where
I was taught evolution was a lie, humans can't impact the Earth, and that
dinosaur bones were buried by either the devil or the government (or maybe
both).  Contending with these diametrically opposed views of science and
experiencing its influence on public discourse has strongly influenced the way I
want to understand the world; through the cold, unforgiving, and objective lens of math. 

After studying biology and chemistry at the University of Utah, I earned a PhD 
in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics under the tutelage of [Rob Phillips](https://rpgroup.caltech.edu)
at the California Institute of Technology. Through studying how bacterial cells
control the action of their own genes, I learned how to approach biological
problems from a physical and probabalistic perspective. I have carried this
manner of scientific study with me where I bring it to bear on the complex
phenomena that emerge at the intersection of bacterial physiology, ecology, and
evolution. 

Beyond biology, I am an amateur web developer and help build and maintain a
number of scientific resources, such as the [Human Impacts
Database](https://anthroponumbers.org). Beyond science, I love taking
photographs, making programmatically generated art, vector based illustration 
(like those on my [research page]({{site.baseurl}}/research)), and exploring the wild lands
of California. Being married to a screen writer, I
also watch my fair share of films and television about which I have hard-headed
opinions, such as an affinity for Alejandro Jodorowsky and Julia Ducournau and a disdain for Star
Wars and Marvel.

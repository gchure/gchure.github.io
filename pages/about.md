The short version is that I'm an anti-disciplinary scientist. The slightly
longer version is that I'm a senior software engineer at <a href="https://profluent.bio">Profluent Bio</a> where I build tools for the
quantitative dissection of multi-modal biological data using a mix of
bioinformatic and AI/ML based methods.

I am the progeny of two paleontologists and grew up in rural Utah where I was
raised in a concoction of contradictions. While my weekends were spent with my
parents helping dig up dinosaur bones and grappling with geology of my
surroundings, my weekdays were spent in the rural public education system where
I was taught evolution was a lie, humans can't impact the Earth, and that
dinosaur bones were buried by either the devil or the government (or maybe
both). Contending with these diametrically opposed views of science and
experiencing its influence on public discourse has strongly influenced the way I
want to understand the world; through the cold, unforgiving, and objective lens
of math.


After studying biology and chemistry at the University of Utah, I earned a PhD
in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics under the tutelage of <a href="https://rpgroup.caltech.edu">Rob Phillips</a> at
the California Institute of Technology. Through studying how bacterial cells
control the action of their own genes, I learned how to approach biological
problems from a physical, probabilistic, and computational perspective. After defending my 
<a href="https://gchure.github.io/phd">PhD</a>, I joined <a href="https://cremerlab.github.io">Jonas Cremer</a> at Stanford University as 
independently-funded NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow where I used a combination of 
theory, computation, and proteomics to study the
complex phenomena that emerge at the intersection of molecular biophysics,
bacterial physiology, and evolution.


I now work as a software engineer and help build and maintain a number of
scientific resources, such as the <a href="https://anthroponumbers.org">Human
Impacts Database</a> and <a
href="https://cremerlab.github.io/hplc-py">hplc-py</a>. Beyond science, I love
taking photographs, making programmatically generated art, vector based
illustration (like those on my research page), and exploring the wild lands of
California with my French Bulldog, Lola. I also watch my fair share of films and
television about which I have hard-headed opinions, such as an affinity for
Alejandro Jodorowsky and Julia Ducournau and a distaste for Star Wars and Marvel.

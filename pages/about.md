I’m an $$n$$<sup>th</sup> year biophysics graduate student in the lab of [Rob
Phillips](https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu) at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu)
in Pasadena, CA. I am deeply in love with anything microbial,
quantitative, or wrapped in tortillas. I firmly believe that the future of
biology relies on an intuition for the physics that governs it. I believe this
is especially true for evolutionary biology where insights from statistical
mechanics will help shed light on the fundamental evolutionary processes that
sculpt genomes.

I am passionate about programming and promote the use of open source software
for scientific computing. As outlined on my [research
page]({{site.github_url}}/research/research.html), I have been using GitHub as a
lab notebook where all code, data, and visualizations are freely and easily
available to the public. You can see a template repository
[here](https://www.github.com/gchure/reproducible_resarch). Eventually, I'll
write something up about my experience with structuring my research to be open
and reproducible from project inception. 

Outside of science, I love taking [photographs, making programmatically
generated art](https://www.gchure.github.io/photography) and exploring the wild
lands of California / Rocky Mountain West. Being married to a
screen writer, I also watch my fair share of films and television on which I
have hard-headed opinions.

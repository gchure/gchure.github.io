## Teaching


Teaching has played an integral role in my development as a scientist. I am interested in
teaching interdisciplinary methods to approach biological questions across all
scales drawing heavily from physics and mathematics as well as from the
computational sciences.

### Computational tutorials for *Bi1 - The Great Ideas of Biology*

<b>Basic DNA Sequence Analysis</b><br/> 
<a class="m-1 btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm" href="http://bi1.caltech.edu/code/t01_sequence_analysis.html">Tutorial Notebook</a><a class="m-1 btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm" href="http://rpdata.caltech.edu/courses/bi1_2017/data/mabuya_atlantica.zip">Data Set</a><br/>
A tutorial on using DNA sequence to understand the biogeography of Skinks on Fernando de Naronha. This tutorial is written to given an introduction to basic programming skills with Python and provides introductory intuition on how DNA sequence can be used to 
 identify relationships between species.

<b>Euler-Forward Integration</b> <br/><a class='m-1 btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm ' href='http://bi1.caltech.edu/code/t02_numerical_integration.html'>Tutorial Notebook</a><br/> 
This tutorial was used to teach undergraduates how to integrate ordinary differential equations using the Euler-Forward method.


<b>Stochastic Simulations</b><br/>
<a class='m-1 btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm' href='http://bi1.caltech.edu/code/t03_stochastic_simulations.html'>Tutorial Notebook</a><br/>
A primer on writing stochastic simulations and using them to understand one of the most powerful forces of evolution - genetic drift.


<b>Quantitative Image Processing</b><br/>
<a class='m-1 btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm' href='http://bi1.caltech.edu/code/t04_quantitative_image_processing.html'>Tutorial Notebook</a><a class='m-1 btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm' href='http://rpdata.caltech.edu/courses/bi1_2017/data/ecoli_images.zip'>Data Set</a><br/> 
This tutorial covered the basics of quantitative image processing and led
students through segmentation of single-celled bacteria to compute the
intensity distribution of a YFP reporter gene. 



<b>Chemical Master Equations</b> <br/>
<a class='m-1 btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm' href='http://bi1.caltech.edu/code/t06_chemical_master_equation.html'>Tutorial Notebook</a><br/> 
Chemical master equations are incredibly useful in understanding the "rates and weights" of biological processes. This tutorial teaches the student how to write them and explore their behavior computationally.

This courses takes a in-depth view at the investigation of biological
phenomena using principles from physics. Typical topics of inquiry are
dynamics of the cytoskeleton, back-of-the-envelope estimation, genetic
regulation, cellular signaling, and evolution. This course is taught all over
the world at universities such as Caltech, GIST, and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory


<b>Intro. to Programming in the Biological Sciences</b><br/> <a class='m-1 btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm' href='http://justinbois.github.io/bootcamp/2016'>2016</a><br/>
A week long course attended by undergraduates, graduate students, and post-docs which teaches the principles of programming and its application to real-life biological problems.

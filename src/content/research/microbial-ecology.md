Microbial communities harbor a puzzling form of diversity: genetically
nearly-identical bacterial strains routinely coexist in shared environments,
even when conventional ecological theory predicts one should outcompete the
others. During my postdoc (and beyond), I've worked on theoretical approaches to better understand competition in microbial ecosystems. Working with [Akshit Goyal](https://www.icts.res.in/people/akshit-goyal), we explored mechanisms ranging from subtle differences in nutrient preferences
and metabolic trade-offs to the role of evolutionary processes like horizontal
gene transfer in generating new strains. This work revealed a fundamental
challenge to ecological theory: the finer we look at microbial communities, the
more coexistence we find—the opposite of what traditional niche theory predicts.
Resolving this paradox will require new theoretical frameworks and creative
experiments that bridge the gap between genetic similarity and ecological
divergence.

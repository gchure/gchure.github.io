All living things share a fundamental ability: they sense changes in their
environment and respond accordingly. This adaptation happens across vastly
different timescales—from nanosecond protein movements to billion-year
evolutionary processes—but the underlying physics remains surprisingly
consistent. During my PhD, I focused on one feature common to all life: the
regulation of gene expression. Using simple thermodynamic models, I
characterized how protein "switches" called allosteric repressors respond to
environmental signals, and discovered that nearly 500 different measurements
could be collapsed onto a single curve defined by a quantity we termed the "free
energy" of the regulatory architecture. This framework proved powerful enough to
predict how mutations alter repressor function—even allowing me to predict the
behavior of double mutants based solely on single mutant data. I then extended
these models to show they could predict gene expression across different growth
conditions, revealing that the same thermodynamic principles govern molecular
responses across multiple physiological states.

abstract: >
    The ubiquity of computation in modern scientific research inflicts new
    challenges for reproducibility. While most journals now require code and data be
    made available, the standards for organization, annotation, and validation
    remain lax, making the data and code often difficult to decipher or practically
    use. I believe that this is due to the documentation, collation, and validation
    of code and data only being done in retrospect. In this essay, I reflect on my
    experience contending with these challenges and present a philosophy for
    prioritizing reproducibility in modern biological research where balancing
    computational analysis and wet-lab experiments is commonplace. Modern tools used
    in scientific workflows (such as GitHub repositories) lend themselves well to
    this philosophy where reproducibility begins at project inception, not
    completion. To that end, I present and provide a programming-language agnostic
    template architecture that can be immediately copied and made bespoke to your
    next paper, whether your lab work is wet, dry, or somewhere in between.

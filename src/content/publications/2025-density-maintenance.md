abstract: >
    Microbes precisely control their composition and geometry across diverse
    growth conditions, yet the mechanisms coordinating these processes remain
    unclear. Here, we integrate quantitative proteomics, microscopy, and
    biochemical measurements to reveal a biophysical principle linking these
    properties in *Escherichia coli*: cytoplasmic and membrane protein densities
    maintain a tightly conserved ratio across growth conditions, while the
    periplasmic density varies. Building on this observation, we develop a
    mathematical model demonstrating that maintaining this density ratio
    constrains the surface-to-volume ratio as a nonlinear function of proteome
    composition, specifically the ribosomal proteome fraction and partitioning
    between cellular compartments. The model holds under guanosine
    tetraphosphate perturbations that alter ribosome levels, further
    demonstrating that cellular geometry is not strictly determined by growth
    rate. These findings provide a biophysical framework for geometry control,
    underscoring density maintenance as a key physiological constraint that
    shapes cellular phenotypes.

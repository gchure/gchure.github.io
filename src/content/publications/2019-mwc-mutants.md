abstract: >
    Mutation is a critical mechanism by which evolution explores the functional
    landscape of proteins. Despite our ability to experimentally inflict mutations
    at will, it remains difficult to link sequence-level perturbations to
    systems-level responses. Here, we present a framework centered on measuring
    changes in the free energy of the system to link individual mutations in an
    allosteric transcriptional repressor to the parameters which govern its
    response. We find that the energetic effects of the mutations can be categorized
    into several classes which have characteristic curves as a function of the
    inducer concentration. We experimentally test these diagnostic predictions using
    the well-characterized LacI repressor of *Escherichia coli*, probing several
    mutations in the DNA binding and inducer binding domains. We find that the
    change in gene expression due to a point mutation can be captured by modifying
    only the model parameters that describe the respective domain of the wild-type
    protein. These parameters appear to be insulated, with mutations in the DNA
    binding domain altering only the DNA affinity and those in the inducer binding
    domain altering only the allosteric parameters. Changing these subsets of
    parameters tunes the free energy of the system in a way that is concordant with
    theoretical expectations. Finally, we show that the induction profiles and
    resulting free energies associated with pairwise double mutants can be predicted
    with quantitative accuracy given knowledge of the single mutants, providing an
    avenue for identifying and quantifying epistatic interactions.

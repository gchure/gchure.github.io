abstract: >
  Allosteric regulation is found across all domains of life, yet we still lack
  simple, predictive theories that directly link the experimentally tunable
  parameters of a system to its input-output response. To that end, we present a
  general theory of allosteric transcriptional regulation using the Monod-Wyman-
  Changeux model. We rigorously test this model using the ubiquitous simple
  repression motif in bacteria by first predicting the behavior of strains that
  span a large range of repressor copy numbers and DNA binding strengths and then
  constructing and measuring their response. Our model not only accurately
  captures the induction profiles of these strains, but also enables us to derive
  analytic expressions for key properties such as the dynamic range and [EC<sub>50</sub>].
  Finally, we derive an expression for the free energy of allosteric repressors
  that enables us to collapse our experimental data onto a single master curve
  that captures the diverse phenomenology of the induction profiles.

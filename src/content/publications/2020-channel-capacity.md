abstract: >
    Given the stochastic nature of gene expression, genetically identical cells
    exposed to the same environmental inputs will produce different outputs. This
    heterogeneity has been hypothesized to have consequences for how cells are able
    to survive in changing environments. Recent work has explored the use of
    information theory as a framework to understand the accuracy with which cells
    can ascertain the state of their surroundings. Yet the predictive power of these
    approaches is limited and has not been rigorously tested using precision
    measurements. To that end, we generate a minimal model for a simple genetic
    circuit in which all parameter values for the model come from independently
    published data sets. We then predict the information processing capacity of the
    genetic circuit for a suite of biophysical parameters such as protein copy
    number and protein-DNA affinity. We compare these parameter-free predictions
    with an experimental determination of protein expression distributions and the
    resulting information processing capacity of *E. coli cells*. We find that our
    minimal model captures the scaling of the cell-to-cell variability in the data
    and the inferred information processing capacity of our simple genetic circuit
    up to a systematic deviation.

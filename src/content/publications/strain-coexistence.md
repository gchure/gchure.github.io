  Microbial communities are often complex and highly diverse, typically with
  dozens of species sharing spatially-restricted environments. Within these
  species, genetic and ecological variation often exists at a much finer scale,
  with closely related strains coexisting and competing. While the coexistence of
  strains in communities has been heavily explored over the past two decades, we
  have no self-consistent theory of how this diversity is maintained. This
  question challenges our conventional understanding of ecological coexistence,
  typically framed around species with clear phenotypic and ecological
  differences. In this review, we synthesise plausible mechanisms underlying
  strain-level diversity (termed microdiversity), focusing on niche-based
  mechanisms such as nutrient competition, neutral mechanisms such as migration,
  and evolutionary mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer. We critically
  assess the strengths and caveats of these mechanisms, acknowledging key gaps
  that persist in linking genetic similarity to ecological divergence. Finally, we
  highlight how the origin and maintenance of microdiversity could pose a major
  challenge to conventional ecological thinking. We articulate a call-to-arms for
  a dialogue between well-designed experiments and new theoretical frameworks to
  address this grand conceptual challenge in understanding microbial biodiversity.

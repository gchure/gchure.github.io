abstract: >
    Membrane transporters carry key metabolites across the cell membrane and, from a
    resource standpoint, are hypothesized to be produced when necessary. The
    expression of membrane transporters in metabolic pathways is often upregulated
    by the transporter substrate. In *E. coli*, such systems include for example the
    lacY, araFGH, and xylFGH genes, which encode for lactose, arabinose, and xylose
    transporters, respectively. As a case study of a minimal system, we build a
    generalizable physical model of the xapABR genetic circuit, which features a
    regulatory feedback loop via membrane transport (positive feedback) and
    enzymatic degradation (negative feedback) of an inducer. Dynamical systems
    analysis and stochastic simulations show that the membrane transport makes the
    model system bistable in certain parameter regimes. Thus, it serves as a genetic
    “on-off” switch, enabling the cell to only produce a set of metabolic enzymes
    when the corresponding metabolite is present in large amounts. We find that the
    negative feedback from the degradation enzyme does not significantly disturb the
    positive feedback from the membrane transporter. We investigate hysteresis in
    the switching and discuss the role of cooperativity and multiple binding sites
    in the model circuit. Fundamentally, this work explores how a stable genetic
    switch for a set of enzymes is obtained from transcriptional auto-activation of
    a membrane transporter through its substrate.

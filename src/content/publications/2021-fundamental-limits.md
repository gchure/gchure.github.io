abstract: >
    Despite abundant measurements of bacterial growth rate, cell size, and protein
    content, we lack a rigorous understanding of what sets the scale of these
    quantities and when protein abundances should (or should not) depend on growth
    rate. Here, we estimate the basic requirements and physical constraints on
    steady-state growth by considering key processes in cellular physiology across a
    collection of *Escherichia coli* proteomic data covering ≈ 4,000 proteins and 36
    growth rates. Our analysis suggests that cells are predominantly tuned for the
    task of cell doubling across a continuum of growth rates; specific processes do
    not limit growth rate or dictate cell size. We present a model of proteomic
    regulation as a function of nutrient supply that reconciles observed
    interdependences between protein synthesis, cell size, and growth rate and
    propose that a theoretical inability to parallelize ribosomal synthesis places a
    firm limit on the achievable growth rate.

    The Human Impacts Database (www.anthroponumbers.org) is a curated, searchable
    resource housing quantitative data relating to the diverse anthropogenic impacts
    on our planet, with topics ranging from sea-level rise to livestock populations,
    greenhouse gas emissions, fertilizer use, and beyond. Each entry in the database
    reports a quantitative value (or a time series of values) along with clear
    referencing of the primary source, the method of measurement or estimation, an
    assessment of uncertainty, and links to the underlying data, as well as a
    permanent identifier called a Human Impacts ID (HuID). While there are other
    databases that house some of these values, they are typically focused on a
    single topic area, like energy usage or greenhouse gas emissions. The Human
    Impacts Database facilitates access to carefully curated data, acting as a
    quantitative resource pertaining to the myriad ways in whic h humans have an
    impact on the Earth, for practicing scientists, the general public, and those
    involved in education for sustainable development alike. We outline the
    structure of the database, describe our curation procedures, and use this
    database to generate a graphical summary of the current state of human impacts
    on the Earth, illustrating both their numerical values and their intimate
    interconnections.

High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is a workhorse analytical technique for quantifying chemical mixtures, but extracting accurate measurements from the resulting data often requires tedious manual processing. To streamline this bottleneck, I developed and maintain hplc-py, an open-source Python package that automates peak detection and quantification from chromatography data. The software implements a robust pipeline for baseline correction, peak identification, and fitting that reduces hours of manual labor to minutes of computation. Since its release, hplc-py has seen steady adoption, receiving 300-500 downloads per month and can be easily installed via pip install hplc-py. The package is published in the Journal of Open Source Software and remains actively maintained with community contributions through GitHub.

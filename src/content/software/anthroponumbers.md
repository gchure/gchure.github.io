Human activity represents the largest ecological experiment in Earth's history,
yet its planetary-scale consequences remain abstract to many people. To make
these impacts quantifiable and accessible, I developed and maintain the [Human
Impacts Database (anthroponumbers.org)](https://anthroponumbers.org) — a web
platform that catalogs key measurements revealing humanity's environmental
footprint. The database includes diverse metrics ranging from annual ice-sheet
melt volumes and ocean acidification rates to residual plutonium in soils from
1960s nuclear testing and global livestock populations. Built in the spirit of
the [BioNumbers database](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/search.aspx) for
biological data, this resource provides scientists, educators, and the public
with authoritative numbers that contextualize human impacts across geological,
chemical, and ecological scales. The platform receives several hundred queries
per month and continues to grow as new measurements become available.
